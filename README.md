# Elasticsearch-search-engine

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Elasticsearch-search-engine project! This project is a comprehensive exploration of various technologies, from handling large datasets to utilizing them for building an application, and ultimately transitioning it into production. The primary goal of this project is to provide both text-based and image content-based search capabilities.

## Features

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Curated and refined the data to meet specific project requirements.
   - Utilized a trained Convolutional Neural Network (VIT) to extract valuable features from raw images.

2. **Indexing with ElasticSearch:**
   - Indexed both textual metadata and image features using ElasticSearch.
   - Enables text-based search through the ElasticSearch Search API.
   - Supports image-based search using cosine similarity on extracted features.

3. **API Development:**
   - Created a robust API using the Elastic Python client and Flask.
   - The API provides access to various search functionalities, ensuring complete control over the search process.

4. **Web Application:**
   - Developed a JavaScript web application that leverages the created API.
   - Users can personalize their search queries and view relevant results.
